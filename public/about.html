<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I currently Live in Porter Texas, enjoying the great weather, making new frends, learning new sports, pickle ball, 
    tenis, and golf. I am a web developer and I am looking for new adventures.
  </p>
  <p>I was a native Californian, born in East Los angeles. California was getting a little crowded, So my wife and I moved 
  to Texas. We are getting used to excessive rain, tornados, huracanes, hot temperaturs, and power outages.</p>
  <p>In California I was a flight Instructor/Pilot, I am retired now, And now I am persuing a career in Web Development, and AI.</p>
